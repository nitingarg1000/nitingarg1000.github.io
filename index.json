I have learned a lot in my projects under Prof. Dootika Vats which helped me gain useful insights into several areas of statistics. I am currently working on analyzing the effect of Increasing Batch Sizes in Covariance estimation.\nI have also had experience with several machine learning tasks from both theoretical as well as practical point of views. I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to my experience as a Summer analyst at Goldman Sachs.\nI tend to waste my time watching movies and tv series, playing video games, and hanging out with friends.\n","date":1563062400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1563062400,"objectID":"e23cb71100d51c11123b1b2597de799d","permalink":"https://nitingarg1000.github.io/authors/alison/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/alison/","section":"authors","summary":"I am Nitin Garg, a senior undergraduate in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at IIT Kanpur.

We’ll talk about many low-level details in the rmarkdown package and the whole R Markdown ecosystem. The two goals of this workshop are: 1) learn how to fully customize R Markdown output (HTML, LaTeX/PDF, Word, and PowerPoint); and 2) learn more about existing R Markdown extensions in the ecosystem, such as flexdashboard, bookdown, blogdown, pkgdown, xaringan, rticles, and learnr. We will also talk about how to use or develop new language engines (languages that are not R), how to develop HTML widgets, and integrate Shiny with R Markdown.\nSee the workshop website for more, and links to individual slides below.\n","date":1577664000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577664000,"objectID":"d24773d366285c962d47f5f8d454c6db","permalink":"https://nitingarg1000.github.io/project/variational-inference-vs-mcmc/","publishdate":"2019-12-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/variational-inference-vs-mcmc/","section":"project","summary":"Comparing the performance of Variational Inference and MCMC on a dataset","tags":["R","statistics"],"title":"Variational Inference vs MCMC","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":["ml"],"content":"add content\n","date":1574812800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1574812800,"objectID":"69631ae9602b2cab682eee8700cdae4a","permalink":"https://nitingarg1000.github.io/project/algorithms/","publishdate":"2019-11-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/algorithms/","section":"project","summary":"Learned and Implemented several advanced algorithms used in competitive programming","tags":["ml"],"title":"Advanced Algorithms","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":["ml"],"content":"add content\n","date":1574812800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1574812800,"objectID":"1d5f6b9b5d0365bfaab7e3cfbb49d3ce","permalink":"https://nitingarg1000.github.io/project/crypto/","publishdate":"2019-11-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/crypto/","section":"project","summary":"Performed Cryptanalysis on various modern cryptography algorithms","tags":["ml"],"title":"Breaking Cryptosystems","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":["ml"],"content":"add content\n","date":1574812800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1574812800,"objectID":"3dbb5f00523032e66fba2715db6a3e84","permalink":"https://nitingarg1000.github.io/project/haskell/","publishdate":"2019-11-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/haskell/","section":"project","summary":"Implemented a scrablle solver in while learning functional programming through Haskell","tags":["ml"],"title":"Haskell Scrabble Solver","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":["ml"],"content":"add content\n","date":1564185600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1564185600,"objectID":"2acb7bde7bfa7bab1df1f2b73e755278","permalink":"https://nitingarg1000.github.io/project/convex/","publishdate":"2019-07-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/convex/","section":"project","summary":"Explored several optimization techniques used in Machine learning algorithms","tags":["ml"],"title":"Convex Optimization Techniques","type":"project"},{"authors":[""],"categories":["ml"],"content":"We will cover:\n The blogdown R package Hugo themes Adding content to personalize your site Posting Don\u0026rsquo;t want to blog? / just want to knit?
